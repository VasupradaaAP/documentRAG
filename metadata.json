The SEP is a monoplane \nwith a reciprocating engine . It has a constant speed propeller , propeller rpm being controlled \nby the pilot via an rpm (or pitch) lever. The fuel/ air mixture may be “rich“ (more fuel) or “lean” \n(less fuel). Total fuel/ air mixture going into the engine is adjusted by varying the manifold \npressure; the higher the manifold pressure, the more mixture being burnt.\nThe SEP manifold pressure is measured in inches of mercury; e.g. “25.0 inHg”.

As the aircraft  \nclimbs, the throttle lever must be advanced, manually, in order to maintain a desired pressure. \nSometimes an engine device can add more fuel/ air mixture automatically, without the pilot \nmoving the throttle lever. Eventually, in the climb, an altitude will be reached where manifold \npressure can no longer be maintained. In this case, the throttle lever will remain at “maximum \nforward” and manifold pressure will start to reduce. This altitude is called “full throttle height” \nand the power is said to be at “full throttle“.\nThe SEP has a retractable undercarriage .
